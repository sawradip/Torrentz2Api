# Torrentz2Api

This is a simple rest API to search and get torrent/magnet links for a specific search. This collects data from ( and thus is an unofficial api of ) <https://torrentz2eu.me/> .

This is mainly developed  as a backend for my upcoming project, **torflix**.

Currently deployed on heroku. You can fork this and deploy yourself, for heavy usage. For trial, contact me at <sawradip0@gmail.com>.

Supported resources:

* /search    
  Request type : POST
  <br> Status Code:
  * 200: Success. Returns link and other things as message. 
  * 301: Either'name' or 'year' parameter is missing.  

 
 
 **New ideas and contributions are always welcomed.**
